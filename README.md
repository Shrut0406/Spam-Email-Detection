# Spam-Email-Detection
This project will utilize Python to create a spam email detection system. We aim to train a machine learning model capable of identifying and categorizing emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). By doing so, we strive to efficiently separate undesirable and potentially harmful emails from our inboxes.

We will follow the standard data science workflow, including data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
